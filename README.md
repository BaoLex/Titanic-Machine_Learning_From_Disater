# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Overview
The **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** competition on Kaggle is a beginner-friendly challenge that involves predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, class, and fare, which can be used to build predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **train.csv** – Contains labeled data with passenger details and survival outcomes.
- **test.csv** – Contains unlabeled data for making predictions.
- **gender_submission.csv** – Sample submission file.

### Key Features:
- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger
- `Survived`: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`: Personal details
- `SibSp`, `Parch`: Number of relatives aboard
- `Ticket`, `Fare`: Ticket details
- `Cabin`: Cabin number (often missing)
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C, Q, S)

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Feature engineering
   - Encoding categorical variables
2. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
3. **Evaluation & Submission**
   - Accuracy assessment using cross-validation
   - Generate predictions for submission

## Installation
To run the analysis, install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and generate predictions:
```bash
python titanic_model.py
```
